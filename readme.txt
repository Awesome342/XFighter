Purpose

So why does this game exist?  Why is it on github?
The reason that I decided to make this game was 
because I thought that it might help me develop
skills for future projects in a smaller scale.
The reason I put it on GitHub was to help sync it 
between multiple systems, allowing me to pull it
down from anywhere, and give backups.  I can't
imagine that any of my friends would want to see the
code or play the game, but if they did this would 
make it easier.

Lisence

I'm a one person developer, doing this mostly to 
learn, so it doesn't really matter that much.  With
that being said, I would still like anyone here to 
respect me wanting the code to be used mostly for 
people who want to play the game, learn from the 
code, or even give me tips.  So basically all I care
is that you don't claim that the code, game, or art
is yours.  The art is from opengameart.org, if you 
were curious, but that's it.
